# Sloppy Noto

Sloppy Noto turns data from space probes into raw audio.

While Sloppy Noto can interpret any csv-like data files containing large quantities of numeric data, it was created primarily to produce audio files out of the raw datasets of various space missions by [The European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) and [The National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://nasa.gov). 

**ðŸš« Noto does not** oscillate or generate sound waves based on given data by other means, modify any such waves, or take artistic freedoms.

**âœ… Noto does** interpret given series of numbers directly as digital audio signal sample magnitudes. _What you see is what you hear._

Sloppy Noto runs in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), using your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) as data source and/or storage.

### FTP crawler utility
As the name suggests, this notebook is a utility for finding suitable data file candidates for audio conversion. It lists all files of 5+ MB recursively from a set directory on an FTP server.

#### Run FTP crawler in Google Colaboratory:
