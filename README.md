# Sloppy Noto

Sloppy Noto is a data audiolizer. It turns numeric data into sound.

- Noto **does not** ðŸš« oscillate or generate sound waves by other means _based_ on given data, modify any such waves, or take artistic liberties.

- Noto **does** âœ… interpret given series of numbers directly as digital audio signal sample magnitudes. _What you see is what you hear._

While Sloppy Noto can interpret any delimiter-separated values format containing large quantities of numeric data (44100 rows of data = 1 second of audio by default settings), as well as some other formats, it was created primarily to produce audio files out of the raw datasets of various space probes by The [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) and The [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://nasa.gov).

Suitable file types include (but are not limited to) `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.tab`, `.lst`, `.asc`, `.log`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.kml`, `.kmz`. Archive files `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz` also work as long as there is a single file inside, that is also suitable for Noto to read.

Sloppy Noto runs in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) (i.e. your browser), using your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) as data source and/or storage.

## Data Crawlers utility
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olaviinha/SloppyNoto/blob/master/crawlers.ipynb)

[crawlers.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olaviinha/SloppyNoto/blob/master/crawlers.ipynb) is a data crawling utility notebook for finding suitable data file candidates for data to audio conversion from online data archives. It contains an HTTP Crawler, an FTP Crawler and a ZIP Crawler, each listing files recursively from a URL, making educated guesses on what might work, based on file extensions and sizes.
