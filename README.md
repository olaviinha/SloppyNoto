# Sloppy Noto

Sloppy Noto turns raw numeric data from space probes into raw audio.

While Sloppy Noto should work with any csv-like data files containing large quantities of numeric data, it was created primarily to create audio from the raw datasets of various space missions of [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) and [The National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://nasa.gov).

Sloppy Noto runs in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), using your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) as data source and/or storage.

### Run in Google Colaboratory
